I have successfully completed Task Two: Student Grade Tracker for CodTech IT Solutions internship.

The Java program allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments. It calculates the average grade and displays the overall grade, including additional information such as letter grades or GPA.

The program also provides options for managing grades, allowing users to add, edit, and delete grades as needed.

Overall, it was a rewarding experience working on this project, and I'm pleased with the final outcome.
